Question 2: Java


Correctness:
The “reverse_string” method in line 9 is being called using an incorrect name “reverseString” which will lead to a compilation. The “maxNumber” variable is defined twice. The “function” method is not being used anywhere in the code and should be removed. The “reverse_string” method is recursively calling itself with a different name, “reverseString”. 


Efficiency:
The implementation of the “reverse_string” method in lines 18-46 using recursion may not be the most efficient approach for reversing a string as it requires a lot of method calls, which could result in the computer program trying to use more memory space in the call stack than has been allocated to that stack.


Style:
The code has inconsistent indentation making it difficult to read and follow. The method names should be updated to follow Java naming conventions, for example, “reverse_string” lines 9 & 18 should be updated to “reverseString”. The variable names are not very descriptive and could be improved to make the code more readable. For example, “myStr” could be updated to “stringToReverse”.


Documentation:
Good documentation.
